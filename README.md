# Friday Independent Project
## By HanleyJames
---------------------
  This weeks prompt is to rebuild a project previously completed in angular. The suggestion was to rebuild a taproom app which is supposed to render everything besides data creation. 
  For those interested in my Dev Notes you can find them [here](../src/assets/md/DEVJOURNAL.md)
  
  As follows are my specs and their completion, objectives, and a brief to do list of other prompts required in the project.

|Behavior|Input|Output|Completed|
|--------|-----|------|---------|
|User should be able to load Home Page|localhost:8080|Loads Virtual DOM with _shared components and Home Components|No|
|User should be able to see tap list|localhost:8080|Loads static dataset for partial information taplist|No|
|User and employee should get 404 page uppon non-existent route|localhost:8080/admin-wp|Loads Error route and component|No|
|Employee should be able to view make brew page|localhost:8080/newbrew|Loads static dataset with new form addition|No|
|Employee should be able to view edit brew page|localhost:8080/employee|Loads static list with edit buttons for each entry|No|



Objectives:
+ Development environment is fully-functional, including Babel transpiling, Webpack module bundling, a development server with hot module replacement, and linting.
+ Components are used to create modular UI elements.
+ propTypes define data types and shapes for all component props.
+ Application successfully uses client-side routing via the React-Router library to create appearance of multiple pages.
+ Styles are successfully added using CSS objects.
+ Project was submitted by the Friday deadline.
+ Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.
